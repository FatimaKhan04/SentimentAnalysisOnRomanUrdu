# SentimentAnalysisOnRomanUrdu
In my sentiment analysis project on Roman Urdu text, I conducted a thorough examination of sentiments expressed in the data through a multi-faceted approach. 
Initial stages involved meticulous text preprocessing, encompassing tasks like tokenization and stop-word removal.
Graphical representations, such as word clouds, were generated to visually interpret the distribution of sentiments. 
The core of the project involved deploying diverse machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Naive Bayes.
Each algorithm was meticulously applied to assess its performance in capturing sentiment patterns. 
Comparative analysis of these models allowed for an informed evaluation of their effectiveness in deciphering sentiments within Roman Urdu text,
providing valuable insights into their individual strengths and weaknesses in the context of sentiment analysis.
